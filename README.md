# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project focuses on creating a server that will identify, authenticate, and authorize users who login to the application. In this project we create middleware that will keep users logged with a JWT, as well as differentiate between which users are logged in along with the permissions that they may have. With the use of a custom mongoose method, we are also able to maintain unique email addresses within the server.,
