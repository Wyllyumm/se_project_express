# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project focuses on creating a server that will identify, authenticate, and authorize users who login to the application. In this project we create middleware that will keep users logged with a JWT, as well as differentiate between which users are logged in along with the permissions that they may have. Using mongoose, we are able to connect to the MongoDB database in order to test the backend of the "WTWR" website. With the use of a custom mongoose method, we are also able to maintain unique email addresses within the server.
